Y,"A small device called an ultrasound probe is used, which gives off high-frequency sound waves."
Y,"You can't hear these sound waves, but when they bounce off different parts of the body, they create ""echoes"" that are picked up by the probe and turned into a moving image."
N,The 3 main types are:
Y,external ultrasound scan – the probe is moved over the skin
Y,internal ultrasound scan – the probe is inserted into the body
Y,"endoscopic ultrasound scan – the probe is attached to a long, thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) and passed further into the body"
Y,An external ultrasound scan is most often used to examine the heart or an unborn baby in the womb.
